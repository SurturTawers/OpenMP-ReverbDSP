# OpenMP-ReverbDSP
Schroeder Reverberator implementation with paralelization of audio processing using OpenMP.

I implemented two versions of this, one sequential to test that it works (secuencial) and parallel with OpenMP (paralelo).

##For this project you need

-OpenMP (with a CPU that has multiple cores)

-PortAudio Library -> http://www.portaudio.com/

-Libsndfile -> http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
         or -> https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile
